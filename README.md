# wifi-clock
A WiFi clock based on the ESP8266-12(e), as you do... It displays the time in the ESSID and supports multiple languages.

It comes in the size of a 18650 battery to be put in any powerbank besides the other batteries.
It's meant to be as easy as possible but has some additional, optional, features too.

Schematic and PCB is done in KiCAD, software written using the Arduino IDE (v1.6) with ESP board support.

Feel free to add additional features and PR!
